/**
  Epetra Finite-Element CrsGraph. This class provides the ability to insert
  indices into a matrix-graph, where the indices represent dense submatrices
  such as element-stiffnesses that might arise from a finite-element
  application.

  In a parallel setting, indices may be submitted on the local processor
  for rows that do not reside in the local portion of the row-map. After
  all indices have been submitted, the GlobalAssemble method gathers all
  non-local graph rows to the appropriate 'owning' processors (an owning
  processor is a processor which has the row in its row-map).
